                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hey there! As stated before, I'm Peter Liu, a 19 year old student in my second year of attending Simon Fraser University. I'm currently working on my Bachelor's in Science, with a major in Software Systems (which I like to joke is the same as Computer Science, but nobody knows what it is when you tell people your major). I enjoy writing, going on long walks, playing video games, and programming (most of the time). I believe my strength lies in my ability to persist through a tough challenge and to quickly learn things with hands on experience! Thanks for checking out my page!</p>

        <div class="about-section-right">
            <img src="placeholder.jpg" height="400" weight="400" alt="An image of something relevant, unless I forgot to replace the placeholder cat.">
            <div class="about-section-right-text">
                <h1>Video Games!</h1>
                <p>I am, as most programmers I know are, an avid gamer. I primarily enjoy single-player games, with some favourites being Minecraft, Terraria, Enter the Gungeon, and Hades. I've taken two game-programming courses in high school, in which I made a static dungeon crawler in my first year and a 2D two-player PVP shooter in my second. I've also delved a bit into video game modding for Minecraft, although I have no published mods. To the right, you'll see the infamous <em>guyperson1 block</em>, named after my in-game username <em>guyperson1</em>, which explodes when mined! A lot of things in the mod explode. It's pretty awesome.</p>

                <p>To the left, you'll see an image of a strange LEGO doohickey; this happens to be a robot that I helped program in MSE 110! The one you see here is a barcode scanner, which records light-sensor readings that can be uploaded to a MATLAB script to find the correct letter. I've also programmed a line tracker and a maze solver as well!</p>
