        <h1 class="center">Hi! I'm Peter Liu,</h1>
        <p class="center">and welcome to my website! I'm an <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/">SFU</a> student currently chipping away at a Software Systems Major, and this page was made as part of an assignment (or more accurately, a lab) for my CMPT-276 course. I'm a lot of things; a programmer (sometimes), a gamer (most of the time), and a chronic procrastinator (all of the time). If you want to know more about me, feel free to click on the "About" page on the header (if I didn't procrastinate on adding it)!</p>
